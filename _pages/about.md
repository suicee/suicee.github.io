**This website is still under construction.**

I am a graduate student from Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua University, China since 2020. I am supervised [Prof. Yi Mao](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ymao/members/).

My primary research interest is on utilizing machine learning techniques and statistical methods, such as Simulation-based Inference, information theory, and generative models, to address various data challenges in the field of astronomy. During my first three years of PhD, I have worked on serveral projects: the application of image segmentation techniques for RFI mitigation, implementing Simulation-based Inference (SBI) methods for parameter inference of EoR and utilizing mutual information for evaluating cosmological statistics.

I am very intereted in machine learning. I have been organizing the Data Science Group at THU-DOA for the past two years. We have been exploring various topics in this field, which can be found in our [repo](https://github.com/ZechangSun/THU-DoA-DATA-SCIENCE). We are open to collaborations with anyone interested in applying these techniques to solve data analysis problems.
