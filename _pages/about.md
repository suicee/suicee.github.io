**This website is still under construction.**

I am a graduate student in the Department of Astronomy at Tsinghua University, China since 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Yi Mao](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ymao/members/).

### Research

My primary research interest is on utilizing machine learning techniques and statistical methods, such as Simulation-based Inference, information theory, and generative models, to address various data challenges in the field of astronomy. During my first three years of PhD, I have worked on serveral projects:

* the application of image segmentation techniques for RFI mitigation
* implementing Simulation-based Inference (SBI) methods for parameter inference of EoR [paper in prep][[github](https://github.com/suicee/21cmNRE)]
* utilizing mutual information for evaluating cosmological statistics [journal paper in prep][[conference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04994)][[github](https://github.com/suicee/MI4StatsEval)]

I am very intereted in machine learning. I have been organizing the Data Science Group at THU-DOA for the past two years. We have been exploring various topics in this field, which can be found in our [repo](https://github.com/ZechangSun/THU-DoA-DATA-SCIENCE). We are open to collaborations with anyone interested in applying these techniques to solve data analysis problems.

### Hobbies

I am a passionate gamer with interests in video games and card games like Yu-Gi-Oh. Currently, I am playing *Baldur's Gate 3* and *Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel*. Besides playing them, I am also interested in making games and have been learning Unity3D to develop my own games. Hopefully someday I can build a "Universe" that I actually understand :)
